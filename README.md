# cypress-cucumber-demo

- This project will show you how to write [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) E2E tests by leveraging [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/). It simplifies the traditional method of writing tests completely in code, enhances the visibility of test cases by having the tests written in plain language, and maximizes the reusability of your code.

### Getting Started:

- Clone and `cd` into the repo, run `npm install` to install project's dependencies.
- To run the example tests:
  - With [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) open: `npm run cy`.
  - For CI/CD pipeline: `npm run cy:ci`.

### Folder Structure:

- Tests: `cypress/tests`.
- Step implementations: `cypress/tests/common`.
- Cypress config file: `cypress.json`.
